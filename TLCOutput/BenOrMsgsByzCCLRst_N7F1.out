Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.0E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.5E-7
10753804 states generated, 2153678 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 52.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 3).
